# 🕹️ Assembly Endgame – Fullstack Hangman Game

**Assembly Endgame** is a bilingual fullstack hangman game built using **React (Vite)** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend. It allows users to guess random words in English or Spanish, while also managing API keys securely, tracking game state, and displaying progress through a fun, developer-themed UI.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me deepen my skills in fullstack development. I learned and practiced:

### 🔷 Frontend (React + Vite)
- `useState` / `useEffect` hooks for state and side-effects
- Component-based rendering with conditional logic
- Keyboard event mapping and interactive UI updates
- Integrating external libraries like `canvas-confetti`

### 🔷 Backend (Node.js + Express)
- Building an Express server with secure routes
- Using `.env` and `dotenv` for API key protection
- Handling HTTP requests to third-party APIs from the server
- Setting up **CORS** for frontend/backend communication

### 🔷 Project Practices
- Full `.gitignore` and `.env` setup
- Clear folder structure with separation of concerns
- API error handling and fallback control
- Professional README documentation
